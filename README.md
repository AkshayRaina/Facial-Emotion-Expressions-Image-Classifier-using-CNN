Facial Emotion Expressions Image Classifier using CNN



This repository contains the Google Colab notebook where I built an Image Classifier for the given Facial Emotion Expression dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions

Please follow below steps to run the notebook:

Download the Notebook from the Github repository
Open Google colab
Go to File -> Open Notebook
Select the .ipynb notebook
Once you are able to view the notebook, run the first couple of cells to import dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions into the Google Colab workspace.
Then continue running the notebook to see the code running and view as per the blog.
